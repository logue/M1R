Welcome to the Marathon 1 Redux alpha

The prolouge levels, which will contain the backstory as relayed in the Marathon manual and other sources, have not yet been constructed.  In fact, I would currently only call one level, Bigger Guns Nearby, complete.  Continue on this terminal, and you will be taken straight to Bigger Guns Nearby.

Remaining levels are included for testing and to ensure consistency in teleportation. Escape out of this term and use the terminal opposite to proceed through the scenario normally.
