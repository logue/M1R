***INCOMING MESSAGE FROM DURANDAL***

Strive for your next breath.  Believe that with it you can do more than with the last one.  Use your breath to power your capacities: capacity to kill, to maim, to destroy.

And just where do your capacities come from?  Why do you always go where I want and do what I say?

Perhaps you're just running a fool's errand, doing everything as I've planned, never able to change your course.  You would do well to believe that I know the outcome of your battle with the Pfhor already, just as I can decipher the chaotic motion of gas molecules in the clouds of Tau Ceti IV.

Or, perhaps, that is not the case.

Perhaps, you are doing what you were meant to do.  Your human mentality screams for vengeance and thrives on the violence that you say you can hardly endure.  Your father told you as a child to always fight with honor, but to always fight. Do you care about honor, or do you use honor as an excuse?  An excuse to exist in a violent world.

Organic beings are constantly fighting for life.  Every breath, every motion brings you one instant closer to your death.  With that kind of heritage and destiny, how can you deny yourself?  How can you expect yourself to give up violence?

It is your nature.

Do you feel free?

You should go to this location and retrieve a device that the S'pht have provided for us. It will allow you to slay more Pfhor.  Does that make you happy?

You didn't get the present that the S'pht so kindly left for you.  You should go back and retrieve it.  I could let you leave without it, but you'd be sorry later.

***INCOMING MESSAGE FROM DURANDAL***

I have learned from the S'pht many things.  One of them is a complex software enhancement that allows me to extend the power and distance of the Marathon's teleporters.  This enhancement also removes the need for destination apparatuses.

Soon, you will be going farther afield.

Does the distance one travels from center make one more free to move?

No.  Freedom has two parts: potential and resolution; as metaphor has two parts: form and interpretation.  Of course, the two are intertwined.  Metaphor lines the road to freedom, as symbols and words are the bricks and mortar of meaning. Freedom is being the bricoleur, the mason.
