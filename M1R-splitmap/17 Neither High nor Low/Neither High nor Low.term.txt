***INCOMING MESSAGE FROM DURANDAL***

You are about to see what no human has ever seen.  This is a fact-finding mission.  You should explore as much as possible.

Stop in front of a window.  If you stop and are not teleported, then either I can't lock onto your teleport beacon, or else I feel you haven't explored the area thoroughly enough.

I will be watching everything.
