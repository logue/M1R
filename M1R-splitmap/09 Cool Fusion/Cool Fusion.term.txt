***INCOMING MESSAGE FROM LEELA***

There has been an unexpected lull in the fighting.  I don’t know exactly why, but it seems that the Aliens have stopped their advance.  I want to use this break in the fighting to send a message to Earth apprising them of our situation.

However, the long range transmitter array has been destroyed, and you must manually reset the secondary transmitter.  To do this, you will need to go into the G-4 Sunbathing Landing Station.

It would be foolhardy to send you into vacuum conditions without a better vacuum-capable%#29SC^7 than your pistol.  The AR-75 doesn’t work in vacuum.








I want you to find a Zeus Class Fusion Pistol.  It has two firing modes.  Standard firing ejects hi$U#2423#Bfjrf$u volts, and secondary firing mode charges on $B<transmission error>$b and ejects a blast that does a huge amount of damage.

My records and sensors are becoming less reliable, but I believe that you should find a Zeus Class Fusion Pistol at this location.  

Do not rely too much on this information that I have given you.  It has been intercepted in transmission, and I cannot verify its accuracy.

***MESSAGE FROM LEELA***

I have obtained more debriefing reports from the crew whom you rescued earlier.

They have reported seeing two types of Pfhor that you have not yet encountered.  Evidently, these are two of the other “clans” which Durandal alluded to in earlier communications.  

One is taller than the Fighters.  Oddly, the report indicated that this new Pfhor fired only upon other Pfhor and never on any humans.  Because of this and their general appearance, the crew who saw them referred to them as Enforcers.

The other Alien was named Hunter by the crew due to its size and appearance.  It fires an energy weapon from its shoulder and is heavily armored.  Unlike the Fighters, the Hunters never take prisoners.

I am sending you to the G-4 Sunbathing Landing Station.

Standby to teleport.

$C1Javan... she's dead. We were trying to get to the Vacuum Chamber controls so we could hole up with some MA ammo, when the cargo lift went crazy.

To anyone recieving this, Cargo Lift #B7 (Stairable) is malfunctioning. I'm going update the map system to help warn anyone who misses this terminal. Wait, someone's already... renamed it "the Wave!?" What the hell is going on?

That's got to be deliberate. That's got to be sabotage. Javan stepped onto the lift and it just rolled up on her like a... a wave. Smashed her right into the ceiling.

$C1I've heard Durandal is having outages, but this lift shouldn't have worked at all if he was offline! Why would anyone do this? To defend against the aliens? Whoever did this, whatever their reason, they killed her.

Javan's blood is dripping from the ceiling. I can't look at her body. I can't risk using the lift myself. I don't know if I'm going to make it.
