***INCOMING MESSAGE FROM LEELA***

Everything is not as it seems{}.  seems{}.  seems{}.  You should be extremely careful.  I have detected Durandal[Tycho] in the Engineering Section, but I don’t know what he is doing. 

My main programs are failing<299.229> 

Be careful.  Everything it not is as used to be.

Tenderly transmitting maps and guidance, but futile.

***INCOMING MESSAGE FROM DURANDAL***

Leela can’t reach you here, but I can.  I am able to access all sections of the ship, and the S’pht have even stopped attacking me- realizing the futility of the enterprise.

Here’s a little hint, you’ll probably need the help:

#PICT 1035
If you want to live, go here and look for a hidden airlock panel.

#PICT 1036
Err,  maybe it was here.

#PICT 1037
No.  I remember now.  It was here.  Yeah, that’s it.  This was the place.  

#PICT 1038
I’m sorry.  Could this be it?  It looks like it.  I can’t find the right map.  Try talking to Leela.  She always was a nice AI.  She could help you.  

Oh, right.  Leela can’t get here.

$BDecompression Completed.$b

#PICT 1039
Just kidding.  This is the place.

Side note:

The S’pht have informed me that he Pfhor are building cyborg simulacrums of the Marathon crew.  I imagine that you will meet some of them soon, and wanted to warn you not to get too close to them: about three meters.
