Currently, Aleph One has a bug that causes depth-testing issues 
with sprites when 3D models and the shader renderer are in use.
If you play with the 3D scenery plugin enabled, under the shader
renderer you may experience bodies and scenery items glitching 
into the floor, and detonation effects glitching into walls.

In light of this issue, I have created 8-view sprites with 
resolutions up to 1024x1024 as a fallback, so you may still 
enjoy viewing Tacticus's scenery from multiple angles if you 
decide to disable 3D models.
